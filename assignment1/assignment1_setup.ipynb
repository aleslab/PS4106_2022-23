    "The demographic data about student populations comes from the Scotland 2011 census table #QS102SC. I preprocessed the raw data to provide an easier analysis for this assignment.   The census data is given in terms of \"Data Zones\" which are small areas of about 500-1000 people.  But because COVID status is potentially sensitive information in order to protect privacy COVID data is released at the \"Intermediate Zone\" (IZ) level.  These are groups of about about 5 data zones.  So when using this data it is needed to aggregagate the demographic datazones into intermediate zone level to be able to combine the demographic information with the covid dataset.  **I have done this for you already.**\n",

    "3) Graph cases/100k overtime seperating intermediate zones with students making up 20% or more of the population and zones with less than 20% of the population being students. Note: We haven't covered how to handle dates.  So I created a column \"Weeks from 2020-03-01\" in the dataset.  Use this for the x axis.  In order to make the graph(s) you will need to make a dataframe with appropriate columns. Make sure you calculate the values explicitly and correctly. \n",
