The census data is given in terms of \"Data Zones\" which are small areas of about 500-1000 people.  But because COVID status is potentially sensitive information in order to protect privacy COVID data is released at the \"Intermediate Zone\" (IZ) level.  These are groups of about about 5 data zones.  So you need to aggregagate datazones together to be able to combine.  \n",
